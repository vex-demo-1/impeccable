/**
 * External concept seed: the dice half of new-work's coupled-direction and
 * established-world surface procedures.
 *
 * The model derives a grounded shortlist of candidate FORMS from the
 * audience's world and the subject's cultural home (see
 * reference/new-work.md). Left alone, it then always builds its #1 —
 * and a single model's resonance ranking is deterministic, so every run
 * in a category ships the same one or two concepts. Measured: 30/35
 * identical concepts across 16 prompt framings; the model cannot roll
 * its own dice.
 *
 * This script rolls them from outside, the same trick that made the
 * palette seed work:
 *   - PROMOTED INDEX: which entry of the model's own resonance-ordered
 *     shortlist must be taken seriously beside its favorites. The dice never
 *     choose an ungrounded ingredient; they only refuse the argmax rut.
 *   - CHALLENGERS (6): outside forms from concept-ingredients.json, two from
 *     each challenger tier (graphic system, instrument language, atmosphere
 *     world), weighed
 *     against the derived candidates on audience identification, product
 *     clarity, system leverage, and use of the medium. They win only when they beat the
 *     grounded list; measured behavior is that they lose to strong cultural
 *     material and win over thin categories, which is the intended shape.
 *   - RE-ROLL (--reroll <n>): round n of the same base key. The script
 *     recomputes what rounds 0..n-1 drew, excludes all of it, and rolls a
 *     fresh promoted index, challengers, and staging. One base key therefore
 *     reproduces the entire chain of rounds.
 *   - RATINGS: the reviewer's approval ratings weight the challenger draw
 *     (3-star doubles the odds, 1-star sits out); the approved pool itself
 *     is unchanged.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope direction --mode persuade
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope surface --mode operate --from <key>
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --scope direction --mode persuade --from <key> --reroll 1
 *   node scripts/concept-seed.mjs --chosen <challenger-id> --from <key> --scope direction
 *
 * --mode names the requested surface's mode (persuade, operate, read,
 * experience) so the appended staging matches its register of work; omitted,
 * the staging rolls from the full approved pool.
 *
 * Challenger data resolves in order: a local catalog directory (the private
 * service repo, evals, and tests set IMPECCABLE_CATALOG_DIR), then the roll
 * API at impeccable.style, then a degraded promotion-only seed when both are
 * unavailable. --chosen sends the anonymous choice ping for API-dealt rolls;
 * DO_NOT_TRACK or IMPECCABLE_NO_TELEMETRY disables it.
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   IMPECCABLE_CONCEPT_SEED — same as --from; for reproducible eval runs.
 *   IMPECCABLE_CATALOG_DIR  — directory holding the four catalog JSON files.
 *   IMPECCABLE_API_URL      — roll API base (default https://impeccable.style/api).
 *   IMPECCABLE_NO_TELEMETRY — disables the choice ping (DO_NOT_TRACK also honored).

each in its own register and pay that translation cost honestly. Translate
its scale, material, spatial or compositional law, tension, rhythm, and
memorable human experience into product structure. Inherit a movement's or
artifact's rules, never just its name: grid, geometry, ornament logic,
material behavior, and information structure become the interface's. Preserve

dashboard, a forest into a taxonomy app, or a performance into a control
console. Translation is complete only when the source name and physical prop
can disappear while a product-native relationship, state change, or proof
remains. A carrier survives only when product evidence makes it functional;
