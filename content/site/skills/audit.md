tagline: "Five-dimension technical quality check with P0 to P3 severity."

## When to use it

`/audit` is the technical counterpart to `/critique`. Where `/critique` asks "does this feel right", `/audit` asks "does this hold up". It runs accessibility, performance, theming, responsive design, and anti-pattern checks against the implementation, scores each dimension 0 to 4, and produces a plan with P0 to P3 severity ratings.

Use it before shipping, during a quality sprint, or whenever a tech lead says "we should really look at accessibility".

## How it works

The skill scans your code across five dimensions:

1. **Accessibility**: WCAG contrast, ARIA, keyboard nav, semantic HTML, form labels.
2. **Performance**: layout thrashing, expensive animations, missing lazy loading, bundle weight.
3. **Theming**: hard-coded colors, dark mode coverage, token consistency.
4. **Responsive**: breakpoint behavior, touch targets, mobile viewport handling.
5. **Anti-patterns**: the same deterministic 25 checks the detector runs.

Each dimension gets a 0 to 4 score. Each finding gets a severity: P0 blocks the release, P1 should fix this sprint, P2 is next cycle, P3 is polish. You get back a single document you can paste into a ticket tracker.

Audit does not fix anything. It documents. Route the findings to `/polish`, `/harden`, `/normalize`, or `/optimize` depending on the category.

## Try it

```
/audit the checkout flow
```

Expected output:

```
Accessibility: 2/4 (partial)
  P0: Missing form labels on 4 inputs
  P1: Contrast 3.1:1 on disabled button state
  P2: No visible focus indicator on custom dropdown

Performance: 3/4 (good)
  P1: Hero image not lazy-loaded (340KB)
  ...
```

Hand the P0s to `/harden`, the theming and typography P1s to `/normalize` and `/typeset`, the rest to `/polish`.

## Pitfalls

- **Confusing it with `/critique`.** Audit is implementation quality. Critique is design quality. Run both for a full picture.
- **Fixing P3s before P0s.** The severity scale exists for a reason. Start at the top.
- **Skipping the dimensions you think are fine.** Theming and responsive are the ones most people assume are fine until they are not.
