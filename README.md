## What's Included

### Commands (15)

**Core Workflow:**
- **normalize** - Align features with design system standards
- **audit** - Comprehensive quality audit with severity ratings and recommendations

**Quality & Polish:**
- **polish** - Final quality pass before shipping (alignment, spacing, consistency)
- **clarify** - Improve unclear UX copy and microcopy
- **optimize** - Performance improvements (loading, rendering, bundle size)
- **harden** - Error handling, i18n, text wrapping, edge cases

**Aesthetic Adjustment:**
- **quieter** - Tone down overly bold designs → refined sophistication
- **bolder** - Amplify boring designs → memorable impact
- **simplify** - Strip to essence → clarity through reduction

**Enhancement:**
- **animate** - Add purposeful motion and micro-interactions
- **colorize** - Introduce strategic color to monochromatic designs
- **delight** - Add moments of joy and personality

**System & Growth:**
- **extract** - Pull components/tokens into design system
- **adapt** - Adapt designs for different devices/contexts
- **onboard** - Design onboarding flows and empty states

### Skills (8)

- **frontend-design** - Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.
- **typography** - Master typography systems that balance timeless principles with modern web capabilities. Creates readable, systematically coherent typography that is both performant and aesthetically distinctive.
- **color-and-contrast** - Build sophisticated color systems balancing aesthetics with accessibility and function. Produces beautiful, accessible color implementations with systematic coherence across all theme variants.
- **spatial-design** - Master spatial design balancing systematic precision with artistic composition. Creates systematically organized layouts with compelling visual hierarchy and intentional spatial relationships.
- **motion-design** - Create purposeful motion that enhances usability and provides feedback without sacrificing performance. Produces smooth, delightful animations that guide attention and reinforce interactions while maintaining 60fps performance.
- **interaction-design** - Design intuitive interaction patterns that feel natural and provide clear feedback. Creates accessible, forgiving interfaces where every state is clear and every action provides immediate feedback.
- **responsive-design** - Create responsive interfaces that adapt beautifully across devices, screen sizes, and input methods. Produces fluid, performant experiences that feel native to each device while maintaining consistency.
- **ux-writing** - Write clear, helpful, and human interface copy that users understand immediately. Produces concise, empathetic copy that guides users confidently through tasks without confusion or frustration.

## Command & Skill Relationships

### Diagnostic Flow
1. **audit** (report issues) → Use specific commands to fix:
   - Design system issues → **normalize** or **extract**
   - Performance issues → **optimize**
   - Edge cases → **harden**
   - Responsiveness → **adapt**
   - Copy clarity → **clarify**

### Aesthetic Direction Flow
- Too boring → **bolder** + **colorize** + **delight**
- Too intense → **quieter** + **simplify**
- Too cluttered → **simplify** + **normalize**
- Too static → **animate** + **delight**

### Production Flow
1. **Build** → Use skills (**frontend-design**, **typography**, **spatial-design**, etc.)
2. **Refine** → **normalize** + **clarify** + **adapt**
3. **Harden** → **harden** + **optimize**
4. **Audit** → **audit** to catch issues
5. **Polish** → **polish** final pass
6. **Enhance** → **delight** + **animate** (optional)

## Installation

After downloading from [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style) or cloning this repo, install for your provider:

### Cursor

**From Website**: Download the Cursor bundle ZIP from [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style) and extract directly into your project:

```bash
# Extract the ZIP directly into your project root
# The ZIP contains a .cursor/ folder ready to use
unzip impeccable-style-cursor.zip -d your-project/
```

**From Repo**: Copy directly from the dist directory:

```bash
cp -r dist/cursor/.cursor .cursor/
```

**Note**: Cursor doesn't support command arguments or frontmatter, so commands work but with simplified functionality.

**Reference**: 
- [Cursor Commands Documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands)
- [Cursor Rules Documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules)

### Claude Code

**From Website**: Download the Claude Code bundle ZIP from [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style) and extract:

```bash
# Global installation
unzip impeccable-style-claude-code.zip
cp -r .claude/* ~/.claude/

# Or project-specific
unzip impeccable-style-claude-code.zip -d your-project/
```

**From Repo**:

```bash
# Global installation
cp -r dist/claude-code/.claude/* ~/.claude/

# Or project-specific
cp -r dist/claude-code/.claude .claude/
```

- [Anthropic Skills Documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

### Gemini CLI

**From Website**: Download the Gemini CLI bundle ZIP from [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style) and extract:

```bash
# Extract and install
unzip impeccable-style-gemini.zip

# Commands (global)
cp -r .gemini/* ~/.gemini/

# Skills (project-specific)
cp GEMINI*.md ~/your-project-root/
```

**From Repo**:

```bash
cp -r dist/gemini/.gemini/* ~/.gemini/
cp dist/gemini/GEMINI*.md ~/your-project-root/
```

**Note**: 
- Commands use `.toml` format with `{{args}}` placeholders
- `GEMINI.md` uses `@file.md` import syntax to load modular skill files
- Skills should be placed at your project root for project-specific context
- For global skills, place `GEMINI.md` in `~/.gemini/`

```

**From Repo**:

```bash
cp -r dist/codex/.codex/* ~/.codex/
cp dist/codex/AGENTS*.md ~/your-project-root/
```

**Note**: 
- Commands are invoked as `/prompts:<name>` (e.g., `/prompts:normalize`)
- The `AGENTS.md` file guides Codex to read modular skill files as needed
- Place `AGENTS.md` at your repository root

```
/normalize <optional-feature-name>
/audit <optional-area>
```

**Codex**:

### Skills

Skills are automatically available once installed. Refer to your provider's documentation for how skills are activated:

- **Cursor**: Rules apply automatically to the context
- **Claude Code**: Skills activated via `/skills` or `@skill-name`
- **Gemini**: Gemini reads `GEMINI.md` and automatically imports referenced skill files using `@file.md` syntax
- **Codex**: Codex reads `AGENTS.md` and automatically loads referenced skill files when needed

## Provider Comparison

| Feature | Cursor | Claude Code | Gemini CLI | Codex CLI |
|---------|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Command Args | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Frontmatter | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (TOML) | ✅ |

## Development

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/pbakaus/vibe-design-plugins.git
cd vibe-design-plugins

# Build distribution files
bun run build

# Start dev server
bun run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Project Structure

- `source/` - Edit these! Single source of truth for all content
- `dist/` - Generated provider-specific files (committed for users)
- `api/` - Vercel Functions for production (serverless)
- `public/` - Website (HTML, CSS modules, vanilla JS)
- `server/` - Bun server for local development
- `scripts/` - Build system that transforms source → dist

### Deployment

The site runs on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with [Bun runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/bun).

**Architecture:**
- **Local dev**: Monolithic Bun server (`server/index.js`) with native routing
- **Production**: Individual Vercel Functions (`api/` directory) for serverless deployment

Push to main and Vercel auto-deploys:

```bash
# Build generates dist/ files and ZIPs
bun run build

# For local testing
bun run dev  # Uses server/index.js
```
