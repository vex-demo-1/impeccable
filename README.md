## The Missing Upgrade

This is the missing upgrade to Anthropic's `frontend-design` skill. Every LLM learned from the same generic templates. Without guidance, you get the same predictable mistakes: Inter font, purple gradients, cards nested in cards, gray text on colored backgrounds. Design Language fights that bias with an expanded skill, 15 steering commands, and curated anti-patterns.

## What's Included

### The Skill: frontend-design

A comprehensive design skill that guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces. Includes 7 domain-specific reference files:

- **typography** - Type systems, font selection, modular scales, fluid type, OpenType features
- **color-and-contrast** - OKLCH color spaces, tinted neutrals, dark mode, accessibility
- **spatial-design** - Spacing systems, grids, visual hierarchy, container queries
- **motion-design** - Easing curves, perceived performance, reduced motion, staggering
- **interaction-design** - Form design, focus states, loading patterns, keyboard navigation
- **responsive-design** - Mobile-first, fluid design, input detection, safe areas
- **ux-writing** - Button labels, error messages, empty states, accessibility

### Commands (15)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **normalize** | Align with design system standards |
| **audit** | Quality audit with severity ratings |
| **polish** | Final pass before shipping |
| **clarify** | Improve unclear UX copy |
| **optimize** | Performance improvements |
| **harden** | Error handling, i18n, edge cases |
| **quieter** | Tone down overly bold designs |
| **bolder** | Amplify boring designs |
| **simplify** | Strip to essence |
| **animate** | Add purposeful motion |
| **colorize** | Introduce strategic color |
| **delight** | Add moments of joy |
| **extract** | Pull into design system |
| **adapt** | Adapt for different devices |
| **onboard** | Design onboarding flows |

### Patterns & Anti-Patterns

The skill includes curated patterns that fight model bias:

**Do**: Use modular type scales, pair distinctive fonts, use off-whites and near-blacks, create visual rhythm through varied spacing, use asymmetry and unexpected compositions.

**Don't**: Use overused fonts (Arial, Inter), use gray text on colored backgrounds, use pure black/gray (always tint), wrap everything in cards, nest cards inside cards, use bounce/elastic easing.
